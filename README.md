# Regional Sales Summary ‚Äì OmniCoder Example Project

This project demonstrates the power of **OmniCoder**, an AI-assisted Python auto-coder, by solving a real-world data aggregation problem: **ranking sales regions based on total sales**. It serves as a flagship example for freelance work and showcases the AI-driven workflow from problem description to verified output.

---

## üìÑ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

1. Read sales data from a CSV file (`input_data.csv`) with columns: `Region`, `UnitsSold`, `UnitPrice`.
2. Calculate total sales for each region (`UnitsSold * UnitPrice`).
3. Aggregate the results and rank the **top 3 regions by total sales**.
4. Write the results to an output CSV (`output_summary.csv`).
5. Return a Python list of dictionaries with the top regions, their total sales, and ranks.

This project was fully **generated, tested, and refined using OmniCoder**, showcasing the AI‚Äôs ability to handle CSV processing, aggregation, and ranking tasks.

## üõ† Using OmniCoder for This Project

The workflow we followed:

1. **Dropped the problem into OmniCoder** (`description.txt` + `input_data.csv` + `test_cases.py`).
2. **Ran OmniCoder**, which generated `generated_code.py` automatically.
3. **Tested the output** against the expected results in `test_cases.py`.
4. **Refined the description and test cases** as needed based on errors from the AI-generated code.
5. **Captured screen recordings** to document progress.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Encountered and Revisions Made

During development, we ran into the following issues:

1. **Import Errors / Syntax Errors**
   - AI-generated code sometimes included **unterminated strings or invalid syntax**.
   - **Fix:** Sanitized the description text, removed stray quotes/backslashes, and ensured proper Python formatting in inputs.

2. **Missing Input Files**
   - OmniCoder initially could not find `input_data.csv` or referenced missing paths.
   - **Fix:** Updated problem description with full relative paths (e.g., `problems/regional_sales_summary/input_data.csv`) and ensured CSVs existed.

3. **Incorrect Column Names**
   - AI sometimes generated code expecting a `Sales` column instead of `UnitsSold` and `UnitPrice`.
   - **Fix:** Enforced exact column names in both description and test cases; included example CSVs in `description.txt`.

4. **Empty or Incorrect Output**
   - Generated outputs were sometimes `None` or did not match expected ranks.
   - **Fix:** Added explicit return instructions in the description and clarified aggregation logic.

## ‚úÖ Results

After revisions:

- OmniCoder successfully generated code that **passed all test cases**.
- `output_summary.csv` correctly reflected **top 3 regions by total sales**.
- The project demonstrates a **complete end-to-end AI-driven workflow**.

## üöÄ Looking Ahead ‚Äì OmniCoder 1.1

OmniCoder 1.1 will include:

- **Upgraded Prompt Optimizer**  
  Ensures descriptions are automatically sanitized, paths normalized, and column names enforced. Eliminates errors like missing files, invalid syntax, or mismatched columns.
  
- **Automatic CSV Handling**  
  Automatically generates example CSVs and verifies column consistency.

- **Seamless AI Code Generation**  
  Reduces the need for manual revisions, making the process **fully smooth and repeatable**.

This project serves as a **flagship demonstration** of how OmniCoder can handle real freelance tasks efficiently and reliably.

---

## üéØ Key Takeaways

- AI-assisted code generation can handle **complex data manipulation tasks**.
- Properly structured descriptions and test cases are **critical for success**.
- OmniCoder 1.1 improvements will further reduce errors and make the process **almost fully automated**.
